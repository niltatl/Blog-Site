    title: "Op-ed: The Benefits Of Open Source AI",
    content:
      "What does the term ‘open source’ mean? Why should you care about it? And why does it matter with respect to artificial intelligence? Open source software typically describes any computer software released under a license that allows users to use, examine, modify and distribute the program and its source code to anybody and for any purpose. Open source software plays a significant role in our daily lives, often without us even realizing it. For instance, the Android operating system, which powers millions of smartphones worldwide, is built on an open source foundation. Similarly, the Firefox web browser, used by many for browsing the internet, is an open source project. When browsing websites, you might encounter WordPress, an open source content management system that powers a large portion of the internet’s sites. Even in the realm of entertainment, open source software like VLC media player is widely used for playing various video and audio formats. These are just a few examples of how open source software has become an integral part of our everyday technology experiences. Open source principles regarding artificial intelligence follow similar definitions to open source software, with a few minor differences as various people have differing views on what exactly ‘open source AI’ is. For context, the output of an AI system can typically be attributed to two main parts: (1) the (untrained) model architecture (implemented through code) and (2) the training data. Some argue that just following the typical open source software guidelines is sufficient, meaning that only the code needs to be made publicly available. Others argue that both the code and the training data should be made available, as the same code trained on different data could produce rapidly different results. And, some further argue that the model weights, which are the learnable parameters of machine learning models (think the product of using the training data on the code, or in other words, the ‘trained’ model), should also be made publicly available. While there are still disputes about what constitutes ‘open source AI,’ all sides of this debate generally have the same intent: to ensure the development of AI is transparent and accountable.",

      "Adopted in many fields, Artificial Intelligence (AI), continues to stir debates about whether its benefits outweigh its threats to human creativity and innovation. While AI has captivated the world’s attention in recent months, AI-generated art – regenerative design that integrates AI – traces back to the 1960s. In the mid-20th century, AI supported the development of computer graphics at a time when computers started to become more accessible. However, a compelling question arises when thinking about AI-generated art: can AI-generated art ever produce anything as original as the works of pioneering artists such as Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí? A major flaw in AI-generated art is how AI operates. AI needs a foundation on which to build and write its algorithms, therefore basing its algorithms on already existing ideas. Some people debate that because humans write the algorithms, AI-generated art is indeed creative and human-driven. However, the problem is that these algorithms replace human decision-making, generating renderings that barely consider human input. Maybe AI could have predicted the work of Josef Albers, a German-American artist known for his methodical superimposed squares that follow specific color patterns, however, what algorithm could have predicted Dalí’s surrealist artwork? Since Dalí, a Spanish artist, was notable for his artwork’s dream sequences and surrealist subconscious depictions, AI could have never created Dalí’s cutting-edge and unprecedented work with algorithms reliant on current images. It is important to note that computer-generated imagery (CGI) and generative graphics (GG) commonly used for special effects in films, such as Avatar, differ in process from AI-generated art. CGI and GG also utilize algorithms, however, these algorithms have creative parameters that rely on human input, requiring more human intervention than AI-generated art. With advances in machine learning in AI, computers can make decisions without human input. ",

    title: "The Impact of Social Media and Workload on Mental Health",
    content:
      "Most days on the way home from school when I’m sitting on the bus I open my phone and go straight to Instagram or Snapchat. Not to check anything specific simply to scroll through and see what people have posted in the past few hours. But when did this become my norm? I remember a time when the first thing I would do on the bus was crack open a book and ignore my phone entirely. While over the course of the bus ride I eventually make my way back to a book, it’s no longer the first thing I do. So when did social media and online communication become so important? Whenever it did, there’s no denying that technology continues to become further ingrained in our society. Whether it’s checking social media to pass the time, texting a friend or completing school work most of the day is spent online. Over the past three years especially, this has been the case, with our phones being the only mode of communication for much of 2020. While we have returned to in-person learning and other social gatherings for over a year at this point, the residual effects of social distancing and quarantine continue to impact social scenes and education.To learn more about Fieldston’s interaction with technology I met with Charlotte Selous from the technology department. Selous said, “when your whole social interaction and all of your social skills are built online and when you come back in person there’s a breakdown in the way you’re communicating and interacting with other people.” She went on to explain how people share information online that they most likely wouldn’t have a face to face conversation about. This oversharing leads to people feeling more comfortable conversing online rather than in-person. Reliance on social media to communicate reduces personal interaction and connection leaving many students feeling isolated from the community. ",

    title: "The Evolving Face of Media ",
    content:
      "The realm of journalism kicked off 2024 with a shaky start. According to Politico, an online newspaper centered around politics and policy, over 500 reporters industry-wide in the United States were laid off in January alone. This leaves us to wonder, what is the future of journalism? Where are Americans turning to get their news? What is the dynamic between the mainstream media and its audience? As these layoffs become increasingly common, we as a society face multifaceted repercussions stretching beyond job losses. History teacher Dr. Tammi articulates, “I do think the general shrinking of mainstream media is a disservice to consumers of information. The layoffs mean a lack of staff to cover important stories on the ground around the world; it means that stories are shared among fewer and fewer sources, leading to a kind of echo chamber that could potentially feel like a validation of information that may not necessarily be true; and it means that the stories that come out may not be as in-depth.”The unification of media sources means stories are exclusively shared within fewer news outlets. This, in turn, creates these “echo chambers” that Tammi introduces. Audiences will then be primarily exposed to information that aligns with their previously existing beliefs, perpetuating biased information. Other developments include stories lacking a deep, critical analysis vital for influential journalism. These types of reports often require time and experience. With the layoffs, we imperil in-depth reporting. ",

      "The world of cinema is a tapestry woven from imagination, collaboration and cutting-edge technology. From the silent era’s groundbreaking special effects to the CGI marvels of today, innovation has constantly pushed the boundaries of storytelling. Now, with the advent of OpenAI’s Sora, a new thread is poised to enter into this ever-evolving narrative: artificial intelligence. Sora is not your average AI algorithm. This powerful text-to-video model can generate realistic and imaginative videos of high quality from mere text descriptions. Imagine conjuring a bustling cityscape teeming with life, a heart-wrenching scene bathed in moonlight, or a fantastical creature unlike anything ever seen before – all through the power of words. Sora’s release on February 15 has ignited a spark of curiosity and debate: what does this AI marvel mean for the future of film and acting? ",
